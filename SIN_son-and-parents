[ Adam seated at his desk slight stage right. Mom and Dad are sitting side by side as if driving a car far stage left ]

[ Lights on ]

Mom:	Oh honey, look isn’t that the bridge?

Dad:	Yep, we’ll be there soon. Finally! 

Mom:	[sigh] I wonder how he’s doing. You know he hasn’t 
		called since he left

Dad:	I’m sure he’s doing great. You know independent he is.

Mom:	Yeah, remember when he ran away from home? 

Dad:	[chuckles] oh yeah! was that 2nd grade?

Mom:	first grade. He was so mad that you took away his Megazord because he refused 
		to clean his room? [hits Dad playfully]

Dad:	[shakes head] He got about a block from home and cried alll the way back home

Mom:	Well, he never did that again

Dad:	Alright, we’re here

[Parents knock on door]

[Adam opens door, shocked that his parents are here]

Adam:	What are you guys doing here?

Dad:	Hey buddy [hugs son] We thought we'd pay you a surprise visit and come see you. 

Adam: 	You guys drove all teh way here...I can't believe it.

Mom:	Oh it went by fast...we were excited to see you again

Dad:	What do you say we go out to dinner? Isn't there that one Korean restaurant that you really like? I forgot what it's called though we
		could look it up.

Adam: 	Oh, no I already ate actually

Mom:	Oh, then maybe you can take us around campus-show us where your classes are

Adam:	uhh, I don't know.

Dad:	Adam? Is something wrong?

Adam:	Hey, I've got it. How about you two have a nice dinner together? Isn't there that one Thai place that you guys really like?

Mom:	[a little puzzled] well yeah there was that one place

Adam: 	perfect! I think that's a great idea. you guys should probably head back soon too, it's along drive so you don't want to take off too late.

Dad: 	Adam? We came to see you, can't you spare a couple of hours with us?

Adam:	[really uncomfortable] look, I honestly don't know why you guys are here. I didn't ask you guys to come, I was just doing my own thing.And you guys barged in here. [ starts to walk around his room ]

Mom:	what? Adam we're your parents, you're part of our life. You're our son.

Adam:	But I don't thik you get it. I don't really want you to be part of my life! [grand pause] It's not like I'm denying your existence or anything. It's just...why can't you guys just live your lives, and I'll just live mine. We don't have to bother each other. 

Mom: Adam, I can't believe what you're saying...

Dad: I didn't know you felt this way about us. Okay. If that's the case then yeah. we'll leave you alone. 

[ parents starts leaving, and pauses] 

Dad: But you always know where to find us.

[ Parents walk out ]

Adam:	[Silence]
