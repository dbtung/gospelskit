[ Battlefield scene. Jack and Bud are hidden in a makeshift foxhole with a wall of sandbags. Battlefield sounds are playing in the background, but they are coming from off in the distance. ]

Jack: So you really want to go to college after this mess is all over? Shoot, we’d be lucky to get out of here alive.

Bud: I guess you’re right. What do you think our chances are?

Jack: Of getting out of here? [ Short pause. ] I don’t know, but they’re a whole lot better than you getting into college. 

Bud: I guess so. Beth always said you were the smart one. I don’t know what I'd do without you. You guys still getting married?

Jack: You betcha - right when I get back. I can’t believe it. Two long years, and I’m finally getting out of this place.

Bud: [ Short pause. ] Hey Jack, I was just wondering. After you get married, do you think things will still be the same? You know, between you and me.  I mean, you’re my best friend. Jack, you’re the only one I got.

[ Explosion. Jack and Bud are tossed to the side with the impact of the explosion. Jack falls stage left, Bud falls stage right. Sound of machine gun noises. ]

Bud: [ Speaking into a radio. ] We’re under heavy fire! Heavy artillery! There are Charlie’s everywhere. Send in reinforcements!
Jack: [ Panicking. ] There’s too many of them! There’s too many of them!

Jack: How many do you see?

Bud: I don’t know. They’re all over the place!

Jack: Let’s get out of here, Bud! Let’s go!

[ Jack starts to flee stage left. Bud moves to follow.  Gun shot. Bud falls. ]

Bud: Jack!

[ Jack turns to help, hesitates, then flees stage left. ]

Bud: Jack!

[ Veterans dinner scene. Jack is sitting at a table by himself, with a centerpiece of American flags and other patriotic memorabilia. He has sunglasses on, and it is clear from how he moves his hands and how he stares off into the distance that he is blind. There is patriotic music playing that fades out as the scene starts.]

[ Bud enters from stage right. He sees Jack and the table, and approaches him. He recognizes Jack, but Jack does not recognize him. ]

Bud: So, you were in Nam?

Jack: [ Somewhat detached and polite. ] Yeah, you betcha. Bravo company. 17th infantry division. There was a village about half a click down river from the Cambodian border.  Battalion had us do recon for about two years.

Bud: [ Slight excitement. ] Bravo company, I remember, I was … [ Composes himself. ] I mean, I heard about Bravo Company.  Everyone was killed or taken prisoner.  I didn’t think I’d meet anyone here from Bravo. [Pause.]  Heard you guys were pretty tight.  You must have lost a lot of close friends.

Jack: Not really.

Bud: You mean they all made it.

Jack: No, just none of them were close.

Bud: Aw, come on, you must have been close-

Jack: [ Interrupts. ] Hey. Look, maybe I was, maybe I wasn’t.  What’s it to you?

Bud: [ Slight pause. ] So how’d you lose your eyes?

Jack: Shrapnel hit me right in these. I was in a foxhole, [ Dramatic music starts. ] when all of a sudden, an RPG whistled in about fifteen yards away.  That thing took out everything in it’s sight - my unit, my CO ... [ Slight pause. Starts to show some emotion. ] my best friend.  Somehow, I made it though.  I went to go look back, to see if he was OK.  But the enemy was approaching .. they were too close!  I got scared!  I didn’t want to die!  I was getting married, and it was my last tour!  If I had gone back they would have killed me, or taken me prisoner.  So ...

Bud: So, then what happened? [Pause.] What’d you do?

Jack: [ Ashamed. ] I ran. [Pause.] I ran.

Bud: I understand.

Jack: Understand?! You understand?! Man, I don’t! My buddy was out there, dying. And I ran like a coward. What kind of man would ignore a cry for help from his dying friend?! [ Gets emotional. ] From his best friend? You know, I never admitted this to anyone, but every time I cover up the truth, it feels like I’m killing him all over again. Even though he’s dead and gone, my lies separate us even further apart.  If only he was here.

Bud: [ Trying to get Jack's attention. ] Jack. Jack, Jack!
Jack: [ Stuck in his own thoughts and guilt. ] Bud, look man, if only you were here!

[ Bud grabs Jack by the shoulders and holds him. ]

Jack: How’d you know my name?

Bud: I’m not dead Jack.

Jack: What?  Bud?  Bud?! Look, I’m so sorry man. Bud, I’m so sorry.
Bud: It’s OK.  It’s OK.

[ Hug. Fade to black. ]
